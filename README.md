# INR-GSEC-Bootstrapping
Govt. Bonds are one of the most liquid instruments in the world, here is how bootstrapping for the Indian G-Sec curve is done by FBIL (Financial Benchmark of India Ltd.)
G-Sec are coupon-bearing bonds that payout a fix amount at a constant interval of 6 months and bootstrapping is the process of deriving the rate which would allow us to give the same value as described above but only difference being that there will be a bullet payment at the maturity period (hence the name: Zero Coupon Yield Curve or ZCYC).
